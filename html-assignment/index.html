           <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I was born in a small city right in the heart of Mexico called Aguascalientes in 1991.In 2009 I studied Communications at <abbr title="Universidad del Valle de Mexico"><b>UVM</b></abbr> in my hometown. I chose this particular branch of studies because Iâ€™ve always been interested in the way we use stories and storytelling to communicate every aspect of our lives.
                
            </p>
            <p>In January 11<sup>th</sup> 2012 I moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in the US to study film. After two years in this wonderful city, I discovered my passion for film photography. I had the chance to participate and work in several amazing projects with very talented professionals and peers.</p>
